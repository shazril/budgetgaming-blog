**Design and Build Quality**

The Ajazz AJ380R is a lightweight mouse with a comfortable ergonomic design. It has a matte rubberized finish that provides good grip and prevents your hand from slipping off. The mouse also has six buttons, including two side buttons, a DPI button, and a scroll wheel.

The build quality of the Ajazz AJ380R is excellent. The mouse feels solid and well-built, with no noticeable creaking or rattling. The buttons are also responsive and clicky.

**Performance**

The Ajazz AJ380R uses a PMW3325 optical sensor, which is a popular choice for gaming mice. The sensor offers a wide DPI range of 100 to 10000, and it's accurate and responsive.

The mouse also has a good tracking performance. It tracks well on both cloth and hard mouse pads, and it doesn't lift off easily.

**Features**

The Ajazz AJ380R has a few features that make it stand out from other budget-friendly gaming mice. One of the most notable features is the RGB lighting. The mouse has a customizable RGB strip that runs along the sides and bottom of the mouse. You can use the included software to change the color and lighting effects.

Another notable feature is the Pixart PMW3325 optical sensor. This sensor is known for its accuracy and reliability, and it's a popular choice for gaming mice.

Finally, the Ajazz AJ380R also has a braided cable. Braided cables are more durable than traditional rubber cables, and they're less likely to kink or break.
